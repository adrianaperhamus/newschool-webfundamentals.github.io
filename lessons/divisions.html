    The New School in New York City is the only comprehensive university where a world-renowned design school, Parsons, joins a liberal arts college, a performing arts college, and many programs and graduate schools including The New School for Social Research to seek out new ways to create a more just, more beautiful, and better-designed world.

  <blockquote>
    "As New School graduates, you have had the privilege to receive an education focused on critical and in-depth study of society, the arts and culture. I challenge you to take the knowledge you have earned here and not only apply it to the insidious messages supporting sexism, racism, classism and other forms of injustice . . . but to also share it out to others. Share it with those who may not have had the privilege of studying in the liberal arts … apply what you know in ways that break down the barriers between academic thought and people’s actual lived experiences."
