      In a document, <i>each element is represented as a rectangular box</i>. Determining the size, properties - like its color, background, borders aspect - and the position of these boxes is the goal of the <a href="http://www.google.com">rendering engine</a>. In CSS, each of these rectangular boxes is described using the standard box model. This model describes the content of the space taken by an element. Each box has four edges: the margin edge, border edge, padding edge, and content edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content area is the area containing the real content of the element. It often has a background, a color or an image (in that order, an opaque image hiding the background color) and is located inside the content edge; its dimensions are the content width, or content-box width, and the content height, or content-box height.
