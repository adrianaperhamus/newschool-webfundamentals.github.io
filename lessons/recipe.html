    <p>Here is a recipe adapted from one written by Elizabeth David, the erudite British cookbook writer who died in 1992. Jill Norman beautifully reanimated it in her 2010 book “At Elizabeth David’s Table” and we took it along ever so slightly in the name of ease: lightly browned cutlets in a sauce of Marsala wine. The cooking is gentle, and takes little time. It pairs nicely with a mushroom risotto or a pile of rice.</p>

    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 turkey cutlets, approximately 1 ¼ pounds</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>PREPARATION</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the cutlets on a wooden board, and season them aggressively with salt and pepper, then lightly dust them with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large sauté or frying pan set over medium-high heat, and when it begins to foam, add the turkey cutlets to the pan. Turn the heat down to medium, and cook, gently, for 3 minutes a side, being careful not to allow the butter to blacken.
